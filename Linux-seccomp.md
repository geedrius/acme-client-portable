In this article, I describe why I'm disabling
[seccomp](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt)
on Linux for the default
[acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client) build.

# Introduction

After implementing a sandbox for
[acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client) with
[pledge(2)](http://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2) (easy),
[capsicum(4)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum&sektion=4)
(harder, but still easy-ish), and
[sandbox\_init(3)](https://developer.apple.com/legacy/library/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man3/sandbox_init.3.html)
(easy but arguably useless), I set out to add a Linux sandbox with
[libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp).

This isn't the first system I've sandboxed
([kcgi](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/kcgi),
[sblg](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/sblg), etc.); but for seccomp, it will
probably be the last.

*Aside: what's a sandbox?*  A sandbox defines the resources an
application will use.  Using anything else results in program
termination.  Each component of
[acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client) is differently
sandboxed: some use only the file-system, some use only the network,
etc.  Sandboxes are your friend:
[pledge(2)](http://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2) on
[OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org),
[capsicum(4)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum&sektion=4)
on [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org), and
[libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp) implementing
[seccomp-bpf](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt)
on [Linux](https://www.kernel.org).  There are others.

After implementing a filter that worked on a local
[Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org) system and releasing, I began
receiving violation reports (e.g.,
[issue/16](https://github.com/kristapsdz/acme-client-portable/issues/16))
for non-Alpine Linux distribution x, y, and z for non-x86\_64
architecture foo, bar, and baz.

A filter violation is when a system call I didn't white-list is invoked.
Sometimes a system's C library would implement a function call
differently from Alpine (things like
[getaddrinfo(2)](http://man.openbsd.org/getaddrinfo.3) differ widely).
Sometimes an architecture would do so.  It always differed.

What disturbed me was not only that I couldn't reproduce --- each report
was from a non-[Alpine](https://alpinelinux.org) C library,
architecture, or distribution --- but that I couldn't verify that there
was a problem at all.  A crafty adversary could have requested a given
system call be white-listed while knowing he could exploit it.  The
burden would be on me to exactly reproduce the reporter's system to
verify the fix.

![This is quite applicable.](http://gifrific.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Aint-Nobody-Got-Time-for-That.gif)

I'm not saying this happened --- I had no reason to distrust any bug
reports, and on the contrary thank everybody who took the time to do so!
The fact remains, however, that it's possible.

I consider this a serious problem.  You should, too.  But if you don't,
there are other problems.

*Note:* I have interspersed this article with funny jokes.  In general
I'm very dour.  Don't be misled that I actually make jokes in real life.

# The seccomp problem

Programming
[seccomp-bpf](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/seccomp_filter.txt)
(even helped via [libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)) is
like programming assembly language.  As for raw seccomp-bpf's syntax...

[Looking at sandbox-seccomp-filter.c...](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/016/986/xl1XYq8.jpg)

However, the problem isn't that it's "hard" (though I think anybody
would find
[sandbox-seccomp-filter.c](https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/blob/master/sandbox-seccomp-filter.c)
difficult to navigate) but that it's not portable: a new architecture
means new (or different) system calls; a new C library means new (or
different) system calls; and a new kernel version means new (or
different?) system calls.  All within Linux!

This is a problem with any capabilities system.  (See [Bugs Ex
Ante](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lqIXr_Or2s4) for a historical
perspective.) For some similar systems like
[systrace(4)](http://www.citi.umich.edu/u/provos/systrace/) on OpenBSD,
this wasn't so bad because OpenBSD's system is uniform: one C library,
one system call interface.

What makes seccomp hard is what makes Linux so popular: one can use the
[musl](https://www.musl-libc.org/) C library,
[glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), or others.  One can use
AMD64 or an embedded system.  You can even compile the kernel yourself
without swaths of otherwise-supported system calls --- and many
distributions do just that.

When I set out to implement a seccomp filter, I naÃ¯vely assumed that the
differences wouldn't be so great between Linux systems.  But this has
shown not to be the case.  Why?

First, system calls between hardware.  For example, some have `mmap`.
Some have `mmap2` (from a previous version of OpenSSH's filter, noted as
"EABI ARM only has `mmap2`").  Do I white-list both?  Just what is
`mmap2`?  [mmap2(2)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/mmap2.2.html)
writes:

> On architectures where this system call is present, the glibc mmap()
> wrapper function invokes this system call rather than the mmap(2)
> system call.  

So I might *use* `mmap`, but the system call is `mmap2`?  Great.

This brings us to the second and larger problem.  The C library.  There
are several popular ones on Linux:
[glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc),
[musl](https://www.musl-libc.org), [uClibc](https://uclibc.org/), etc.
Each of these is free to implement any standard function (like `mmap`,
above) in any way.  So while my code might say `read`, the C library
might also invoke `fstat`.  Great.

In general, section 2 calls (system calls) map evenly between system
call name and function name.  However, section 3 was all over the place.
The strongest differences were between big functions like
[getaddrinfo(2)](http://man.openbsd.org/getaddrinfo.3).

Then there's local modifications.  And not just between special embedded
systems.  But Debian and Arch, both using
[glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc), have different kernels
installed with different features.  Great.

# The Linux problem

The seccomp problem is a Linux problem. 

If in order to secure a non-trivial application (where trivial is "pure
computation" --- meaning no system calls) requires users to baby-sit its
runtime, then I've just narrowed my potential audience to those who have
the time and patience to do so.  Which, for them, means they want the
software so badly they're willing to sacrifice the time.

How often does that happen to you?

Moreover, not everybody who really wants to use my software knows how to
program --- in fact, I'd guess that most don't at all, being that
[acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client) is for administering
certificates, not writing code.  So if my program is meant to provide a
service to people, but people can't use it --- what's the point of
releasing it as open source?

![What's the point?](http://www.theimaginativeconservative.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/peter-sellers-as-dr-strangelove-1.jpg)

# The ~~ego~~ developer problem

When I first released
[acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client), I assumed that users
would let me know if their systems failed, and how.  What I didn't
anticipate was how much the seccomp filter would be violated even though
I carefully verified my test environment with a popular Linux on a
popular architecture.

In the end, I took a lot of my potential users' time, took a lot of my
own time tracking down system call violations, and alienated everybody
else who just gave up when it failed.

What's more embarrassing is that, to most users who simply downloaded
the software, the application just *failed*.  Not *seccomp failed*, but
*[acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client) failed*.  Ouch.

What solutions do I have?  If I stay with seccomp, I continue to
alienate general users and requiring skilled users (where "skilled" is a
function of programming, not skilled in the domain of the application)
to jump through hoops, and spend lots of my own time to interpret
incoming violation reports from said skilled users.

All the while, other people trying the software just think it's crap.

Fact is, using seccomp is difficult unless

1. the system really is trivial (pure computation), which reduces the
   probability of users having violations;
2. the users are extremely skilled, which reduces the problem that users
   will abandon the software; or
3. I have the resources to properly test on most systems before
   releasing.

It seems to me that seccomp is designed for big companies who can afford
the resources (like those rhyming with "doodle"), big open source
projects with ~~more intelligent developers and~~~ testing
infrastructure like OpenSSH, or niche scientific systems.

That leaves [acme-client](https://kristaps.bsd.lv/acme-client) out of
the loop.

Is this a problem?  It depends on the software, I guess.  But it's not
*my* software that should scare you.  It's the many unwritten pieces of
software, or written but unsecured, that you will never know about, or
never use.  Because an environment hostile to small-time folks like
myself cuts away the life-blood of the community.

Fortunately, there's always OpenBSD!

![You called?](https://www.linux.org.ru/gallery/4888769.jpg)

This article isn't supposed to be about OpenBSD's
[pledge(2)](http://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2).  Or even FreeBSD's
[capsicum(4)](https://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=capsicum&sektion=4),
which is eminently more usable than either seccomp-bpf or libseccomp.

But really it kinda is, because it's important to show an example of how
*not* to go down the seccomp road.

On both of these systems, I *know* that when I sandbox a given
capability, it will be sandboxed for all of my users.  Whether that
would remain if the C library were switchable is another story.

# Solutions

I've now disabled the seccomp code in the [GNUmakefile](GNUmakefile).

If you want to enable it, you're welcome to --- all of the code is still
there in [sandbox-seccomp.c](sandbox-seccomp.c) and fairly easy to read.  
Note that the debugging is enabled by default, and the functions it
isn't are safe to use in a signal context.  So if you use it a lot, that
might get annoying.

If you add system calls to the filter white-list, please notify me and
I'll make sure it makes its way into
[sandbox-seccomp.c](sandbox-seccomp.c) so you don't need to maintain a
downstream.

However, there's still the issue of trust.  Can I trust that what I put
in that code --- even if it's "only for experts" --- isn't a whole
waiting to be exploited?  Am I putting other skilled people at risk?
Can you trust what you see there, knowing it was provided by others?

There isn't an easy answer to this.

# Disclaimers

I don't have anything against libseccomp or seccomp except for something
that [I was
told](https://mail-index.netbsd.org/tech-kern/2007/12/29/0007.html) many
years ago: "I find the documentation inscrutable".
